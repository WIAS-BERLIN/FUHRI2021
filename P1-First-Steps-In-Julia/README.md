* Types like: Float64, Complex, Rational, BigFloat
* Multiple Dispatch
* Linear Algebra
* Dual Numbers and Automatic Differentiation
* Visualization
* Package Manager
* Pluto Notebooks for Education
* DifferentialEquations.jl
* Sampling with MonteCarlo or QuasiMonteCarlo methods
* Parallelization?
* Code Profiling, machine-oriented functionality like peakflops()
