Julia Hackathon -- Automatic Differentiation
============================================

This project explores some of the automatic differentiation capabilities of Julia, mainly the ForwardDiff.jl package. We start with a tutorial that
covers some theoretical background, practical use cases and some training exercises. The tutorial is given in the form of an interactive
Pluto notebook (tutorial_autdiff.jl).

After this introduction we will work on some (not too serious) project related to optimisation and image processing where you can use what you have learned
and can hack to your heart's content.

To run the tutorial, please install the following packages via the Julia package manager
(e.g. by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL and then `add [PackageName]`):

- ForwardDiff
- ReverseDiff
- DiffResults
- Pluto
- PlutoUI

To take part in the project you will need these packages in addition:

- Images
- ImageView (recommended for visual feedback)
- Gtk (recommended for visual feedback)
