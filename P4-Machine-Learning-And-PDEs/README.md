Julia Hackathon -- Machine learning and PDEs
============================================

In this project, we will explore the connections between machine learning and of partial differential equations via 
**Neural Networks**.

We will discuss the identification of the nonlinear interactions in a simple Lotka-Volterra ODE example based on noisy data with the help of neural networks and the Sparse IDentification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach.
To demonstrate  discovery  of spatiotemporal equations  directly from  data,  weconsider data generated from the one-dimensional Fisher-KPP(Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov) PDE.
To reconstruct the diffusion operator, we will use a convolutional neural network.

All steps are contained in the Pluto notebook
`nb_machine_learning.jl`.
