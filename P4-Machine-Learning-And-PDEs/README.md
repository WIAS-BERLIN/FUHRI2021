Julia Hackathon -- Machine learning and PDEs
============================================

In this project, we will explore the connections between machine learning and solving of partial differential equations via **Physics-Informed Neural Networks** (PINNs).

We will discuss the background of PINNs and implement solvers for some typical PDE problems.

The implementation will be based on the `NeuralPDE` package ([GitHub](https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl)). To install it simple press `]` in the Julia REPL and then `add NeuralPDE`. Alternatively, you can write directly in the REPL

```Julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("NeuralPDE")
```

We will upload a Pluto notebook in this repository soon!
